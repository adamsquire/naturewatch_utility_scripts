# Nature Watch utility scripts

A set of utility scripts that I use with my [nature watch camera](https://adamsramblings.xyz/blog/naturewatch-camera/) which runs software from  [https://mynaturewatch.net/](https://mynaturewatch.net/). See blog post at [https://adamsramblings.xyz/blog/sorting-2000-plus-jpg-files-into-folders](https://adamsramblings.xyz/blog/sorting-2000-plus-jpg-files-into-folders) for description:

| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
